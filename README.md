# Contract Test Demo

A project to introduce contract testing using the pacto-php library. The consumer
and provider folders illustrate two independent separate servers that share a
messsage API. The messages are stored as contracts (generated by consumer) and are
validated (by the provider) at a later time.

## Requirements
- [pacto-php](https://)
